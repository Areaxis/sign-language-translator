🤟 **Sign Language Translator**

A real-time Sign Language Translator built using computer vision and machine learning. This project detects hand gestures from sign language and converts them into readable English text (and optionally, speech), helping bridge the gap between deaf/mute individuals and those who don’t understand sign language.


🚀 **Features**

✅ Real-time hand gesture detection via webcam
🧠 Translates sign language into English text
🖥️ Simple, intuitive interface for easy use
🧪 Custom-trained or pre-built model integration


🛠️ **Technologies Used**

- Python 3.10
- OpenCV – for real-time video and hand detection
- Mediapipe – for hand tracking and keypoint extraction
- TensorFlow / PyTorch (if using a custom model)
- Tkinter / Streamlit / Flask – for GUI or web UI
- gTTS / pyttsx3 – for converting text to speech


**Install dependencies**

pip install -r requirements.txt


**Run the app**
